## ServiceInsight

Essential insights for distributed solutions

Verifying that large distributed solutions function correctly is no easy

processes.
ServiceInsight gives you visibility across queues, processes, and
machines showing messages whose processing has failed (and for what reason) as well as their relation to other messages.
