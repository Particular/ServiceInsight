# ServiceInsight

## 🚨 Sunset Notice

**ServiceInsight has been officially sunsetted.**  
Its core features have been moved to **ServicePulse**, which is now the recommended tool for monitoring and debugging distributed systems. New development on ServiceInsight has stopped.

## Overview

ServiceInsight provides essential insights for distributed solutions. Verifying that large distributed solutions function correctly is no easy task, especially with many asynchronous and loosely-coupled processes. ServiceInsight gives you visibility across queues, processes, and machines showing messages whose processing has failed (and for what reason) as well as their relation to other messages.

It is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

See the [ServiceInsight documentation](http://docs.particular.net/serviceinsight/) to learn more.

## How to build

You can build ServiceInsight using Visual Studio 2015 or later.

### Prerequisites

If using Visual Studio 2017, ensure that you have installed:

- Workloads
  - .NET desktop development

You can check whether the prerequisites have been installed by running the Visual Studio Installer and clicking "Modify".
