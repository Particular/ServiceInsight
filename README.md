# ServiceInsight

## 🚨 Sunset Notice

**ServiceInsight has been officially sunsetted and will be deprecated on February 10th, 2027.**  

Its core features have been moved to [**ServicePulse**](https://docs.particular.net/servicepulse/), which is now the recommended tool for monitoring and debugging distributed systems. No further updates will be made and support will end after the deprecation date..

## Overview

ServiceInsight provides essential insights for distributed solutions. Verifying that large distributed solutions function correctly is no easy task, especially with many asynchronous and loosely-coupled processes. ServiceInsight gives you visibility across queues, processes, and machines showing messages whose processing has failed (and for what reason) as well as their relation to other messages.

It is part of the [Particular Service Platform](https://particular.net/service-platform), which includes [NServiceBus](https://particular.net/nservicebus) and tools to build, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

See the [ServiceInsight documentation](http://docs.particular.net/serviceinsight/) to learn more.
