### ServiceInsight

Essential insights for distributed solutions

Verifying that large distributed solutions function correctly is no easy
task, especially with many asynchronous and loosely-coupled
processes.
ServiceInsight gives you visibility across queues, processes, and
machines showing messages whose processing has failed (and for what reason) as well as their relation to other messages.
